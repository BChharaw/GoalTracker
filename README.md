# Goal for the Day

[Goal for the Day](https://bchharaw.github.io/#/projects/goalfortheday)

When I was first learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I created this simplistic website to track goals using cookies in the browser. I designed it for personal use to hold myself more accountable for the goals I set. It served as my default browser homepage during high school and greatly improved my productivity.

## Features
- Allows you to set exactly one goal each day
- Displays a list of previous goals
- Edit the goal of the day simply by typing something new

## Usage

3. The website will display your goal for the day and keep a list of your previous goals
